# Natural Language Understanding Project
This project focuses on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and specifically the tasks of Intent Classification and Slot Filling.
## Intent Classification
Intent Classification is a text classification task in which the goal is to assign an intent to a given sentence or utterance.
## Slot Filling
Slot Filling is a sequence labeling task where the objective is to map a given sentence or utterance to a sequence of domain-slot labels.
## Project Goal
The aim of this project is to implement a neural network that predicts intents and slots in a multitask learning setting. The dataset used for this project is tiny, therefore the model must be trained and tested from scratch at least 5 times to report the average and standard deviation.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found at the following link: https://github.com/BrownFortress/IntentSlotDatasets.
